df_docker
=========

In [our](http://mefightclub.com) continuing effort to enjoy a multiplayer [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) server, we experiment with [docker](www.docker.com). 

Currently [auto-builds](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/gjigsaw/df-docker/) and includes [DFHack](https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack) and a pre-generated region.

To Run
======
First, [Install Docker](http://docs.docker.com/installation/).

Then, Run the df-docker container:

docker -i -t gjigsaw/df-docker
